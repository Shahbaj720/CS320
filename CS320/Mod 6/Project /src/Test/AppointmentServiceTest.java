	 * The following tests exercise the AppointmentService class. In each test, a new
	 * service is created with default values for each field. Then the service is
	 * requested to make some change to the list of tasks and the result is
	 * tested to ensure the actual field matches what is expected.
	 *
	 * Because each appointment that gets created has a new automatically assigned
	 * appointmentID, and the tests are run based on that appointmentID, the order in which
	 * the tests are run depend on the value of each appointmentID. Therefore,
	 * the @Order annotation is used to keep the tests in a specific order.
	 *
	 * For evidence that the appointmentID is correct for each test, uncomment the
	 * service.displayAppointmentList(); prior to each assertion so that the records are
	 * displayed on the console for error checking.
