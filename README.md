How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I use thorough testing (unit, integration, and security tests) and follow best practices like secure coding standards, regular code reviews, and continuous integration. These steps help detect potential bugs or vulnerabilities early and ensure reliability.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I gather requirements by talking with users, creating user stories, and prioritizing features that directly address user goals. This approach keeps me focused on value-added functionality and user satisfaction.

How do I approach designing software?
I start by understanding the problem domain, then I create an architecture or design that balances clarity, scalability, and maintainability. I iterate quickly, gather feedback often, and adapt my design to emerging requirements or constraints.
